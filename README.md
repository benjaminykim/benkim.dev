Ben Kim's personal website, built using Gatsby and React. Deployed using Netlify.

## Deployment

Deployment requires environment variables, inspect the `.env.example` file to see which fields are needed.

Since deployment is done through Netlify, use the web console to set these variables.

Local Deployment runs `gatsby develop` while production simply requires a push to this remote repository as Netlify is
hooked to this.
