# My first blog post...
It's taken three days of debugging, lazy learning of GraphQL, and documentation grinding to get to this stage of my personal website where I have a functioning blog portal with Netlify CMS.

So far, so good. My next steps are:
- add `disqus` comments feature into each blog page
- finish cleaning up the blog preview in the blog entrypoint page
- make the blog page template beautiful
    - make sure that the lovely markdown style is showing. here's a quick test `test`. Looks like it's html :(
- write a dope first blog about githooks
- delete this welcome post, let's keep it professional :)
